Installation
============
This page will guide you through three required steps:

#. Make sure that all Python requirements are met
#. Install the CNTK binaries
#. Install the Python API and set it up

Requirements
------------
You will need the following Python packages: 

:Python: 2.7 (but you have already 3.3+ running, have you?)
:NumPy: 1.10
:Scipy: 0.17

On Linux a simply ``pip install`` should suffice. On Windows, you will get
everything you need from `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

Installing CNTK
---------------
Please follow the instruction on `CNTK's GitHub page <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/CNTK-Binary-Download-and-Configuration>`_. After you have built the CNTK binary, find the build location. It will be something like ``<cntkpath>/x64/Debug_CpuOnly/cntk``. You will need this for the next step.

Installing the Python module
----------------------------
#. Go to ``<cntkpath>/contrib/Python`` and run ``python setup.py install``
#. Set up the environment variable ``CNTK_EXECUTABLE_PATH`` to point to the
   CNTK executable
#. Enjoy Python's easy of use with CNTK's speed::

>>> import cntk as cn
>>> cn.__version__
1.5
>>> with cn.Context('demo', clean_up=False) as ctx:
...     a = cn.constant([[1,2], [3,4]])
...     print(ctx.eval(a + [[10,20], [30, 40]]))
[[11.0, 22.0], [33.0, 44.0]]

In this case, we have set ``clean_up=False`` so that you can now peek into the
folder ``_cntk_demo`` and see what has been created under the hood for you.

Most likely, you will find issues or rough edges. Please help us improving CNTK
by posting them to https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues. Thanks!
